## 2.1. Study sites

The study was conducted on four undisturbed natural forest sites of maritime pine (*Pinus pinaster* Aiton), black pine (*Pinus nigra* Arn.), Bulgarian fir (*Abies borisii* regis, Matf.), and beech (*Fagus silvatica* L.).
The maritime pine site was derived from natural reforestation and the black pine site includes even aged stands derived from natural reforestation on abandoned eroded soils.
The fir and beech sites are comprised of uneven aged stands mature for harvesting.
The stand characteristics of the study sites are given in Table 1.
In each forest site, two square 0.5 ha plots were established on different site qualities, high (Hsq) and low site quality (Lsq).
Site qualities were determined according to @Apatsidis1990 and @Panagiotidis1981.
Ground vegetation in all sites was almost absent.

The maritime pine site was located in Kilkis (41°06′N, 22°53′E), approximately 70 km northwest of Thessaloniki with a semi-arid Mediterranean climate.
Average forest floor depth was 1–3 cm, and humus was of the xeromoder type [@Klinka1981].
The soil developed on gneiss and schists is shallow, well drained and acidic, with a sandy loam texture, and is classified as Eutric Cambisol [@FAO1988] (Table 2).
The black pine site (40°23′N, 22°32′E) was located on the northwest-facing slope of the Pieria mountains.
The climate is characterized as sub-Mediterranean to temperate.
The humus profile is of the mull-moder type at the Hsq and xeromoder at the Lsq [@Klinka1981].
Average forest floor depth ranged from 1.1 to 4.4 cm and overlayed an abandoned cultivated soil derived from the weathering of gneiss.
The soil was poor in organic matter, with a sandy loam texture.
The fir site was located in the University forest of Pertouli (39°30′N, 21°25′E) on Pindos mountain and the climate is characterized as sub-Mediterranean to temperate.
Humus at the two site qualities was of mull-moder type [@Klinka1981].
The mineral soil, formed on flysch parent material, was deep, acidic, and sandy loam in texture.
The beech site (39°50′N, 22°30′E) was located on the northeast-facing slope of mountain Ossa.
The climate is attenuated as sub-Mediterranean with rainy winters.
The forest floor was 1.5–5.4 cm thick and the humus was of the mull type at the Hsq and of the mull-moder type at the Lsq [@Klinka1981].
The soil derived from schists was, acidic, rich in organic matter, with a clay loam texture.
Soils under the black pine, fir and beech sites are classified as Dystric Cambisols [@FAO1988].
