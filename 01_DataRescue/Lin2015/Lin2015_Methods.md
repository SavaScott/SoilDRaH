## Litter collection and UV treatment

Litter samples of *B. diandrus* were collected from the University of California’s Sedgwick Reserve in Santa Ynez, California, USA (43°42′N, 120°2′W; 25 km north of Santa Barbara).
A detailed description of the site can be found in @Lin2014.
Briefly, the site is dominated by European annual grasses, particularly *B. diandrus*, and it experiences a Mediterranean climate of distinct wet and dry seasons with average annual precipitation of 380 mm, mostly occurring between November and April.
Annual grasses typically fully senesce by late April.
Senesced litter lying across the ground surface forms a litter layer of 5 to 15 cm thickness, the surface of which is exposed to intensive solar radiation during the dry season from May to September.
To manipulate UV radiation (280–400 nm) received by litter samples, 20 pairs of steel frames (l×w×h: 75×150×25 cm) were constructed with plastic louvers that either block or pass UV radiation.
A subset of the screens were used in @Lin2014, which reported the technical details of these screens, including dimensions, placement, optical properties, and effects on air temperature and relative humidity.
In short, the "UV block" screens eliminated 93 and 85% of UV-A (315–400 nm) and UV-B (280–315 nm) radiation, respectively, whereas the "BUV pass" screens transmitted 80 and 79% of UV-A and UV-B radiation, respectively.
Screens allowed penetration of rainfall and controlled for heating by having a louvered design.
There was no difference between UV block and UV pass screens in their effects on photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), air temperature, or relative humidity.

Litter samples were under either UV block or UV pass treatments in the field for three periods (summer, summer-winter, and one year) (Table 1).
For litter that received UV treatments in summer, 10 pairs of UV block and UV pass screens were placed over areas dominated by litter of *B. diandrus* in mid August, 2011.
During the set-up of the screens, some standing litter was pushed over by hand so that it would fit underneath the screens.
In late October 2011, litter was removed from under the screens resulting in UV treatment that lasted for 2.5 months.
Only litter at the very top of the thatch layer and constantly exposed to solar radiation was collected for this study.
The other two sets of litter were obtained from the experiment reported in @Lin2014.
In short, *B. diandrus* litter was sealed in 20×20 cm aluminum bags of 1.5-mm mesh size and suspended at 5 cm beneath the louvers of 10 pairs of UV pass and UV block screens and above the thatch layer in the field in mid August, 2011.
The bags were supported from below by a stainless steel screen.
The UV screens were not the same ones used for treating litter during summer, but they were identical in design.
Litter samples (*n*=10) were collected both in early March 2012 and early September 2012 to achieve UV radiation exposure periods of summer-winter and 1 year, respectively.
These three sets of litter all originated from the 2010–2011 growing season at the same field site.
Even though that aluminum mesh bags were not used for samples exposed during summer, we believe the use of mesh bags was not a confounding factor to the exposure period.
The aluminum mesh material transmits greater than 70% of UV radiation, and its mesh size is big enough for microbial decomposers to colonize the litter inside the mesh.

We monitored UV radiation at 1.7 m above the soil surface with a broadband UV radiometer (CUV5, Kipp & Zonen) at a meteorological station adjacent to the site.
After considering light transmission of screens and aluminum mesh, as well as length of exposure, we estimated the amount of UV radiation received by each treatment during field exposure (Table 1).

## Sample processing and chemical analysis

After collection of the litter from the field site, green plants, visible soil, and arthropods were removed from the litter.
Litter was then oven-dried at 55°C for 2 days.
Four out of ten replicates were randomly taken from each combination of UV treatment and exposure duration for chemical analysis and measurement of biodegradability.
These samples were ground using a Wiley mill with U.S. standard #20 mesh.

We analyzed litter carbon fractions, including the cell solubles fraction (which includes soluble carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids; hereafter, cell solubles), hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin, using a sequential extraction technique [@VanSoest1963].
Subsamples were treated with neutral fiber detergent, acid fiber detergent, and sulfuric acid digestions using an ANKOM fiber analyzer (Type 2000, ANKOM Technology).
We refer to the fraction left after sulfuric acid digestion as ‘lignin’ so that our results can be compared with many previous studies that have adopted the same method in examining litter decomposition and photodegradation [@Austin2006; @Brandt2010; @Rozema1997].
We recognize that this lignin fraction also includes cutin, suberin, and waxes [@vonLutzow2007].
For litter C and N concentrations, subsamples were ground to powder using a roller mill and analyzed using an elemental analyzer (Fisons NA1500, Fisons Instruments) with acetanilide standards.
Each sample was analyzed in duplicate, and the average value was used.
For extraction, a 100 mg subsample was soaked in 50 ml deionized water at 4°C for 24 h.
Extracts were filtered through glass fiber filter paper (Type A/E, Pall Corporation) and analyzed for water extractable C (WEC) and N (WEN) using a total organic C/total N (TOC/TN) analyzer (Series V, Shimadzu Corporation).
Potassium hydrogen phthalate and potassium nitrate were used to prepare the standards for WEC and WEN, respectively.
WEC and WEN were calculated as the average of three measurements.
All litter chemical characteristics were reported on a dry litter mass basis.

## Litter biodegradability

Litter biodegradability was evaluated by measuring microbial respiration in a 25-day laboratory incubation experiment on subsamples of the coarsely ground litter (*n*=4, #20 mesh).
Subsamples (250 mg each) were first placed into 50-mL plastic beakers.
Microbial inoculum was added to introduce a uniform community of decomposers to all of the litter samples and to offset potential effects of UV exposure on the microbial community on the litter itself.
To make the microbial inoculum, soil from the field site was mixed with water at 1:3.5 (soil:water, mass:volume ratio) and extracted at 50 rpm on a bench shaker for 2 h.
After shaking, the extract was filtered through Whatman 40 filter paper to remove soil particles and then used as microbial inoculum.
For each plastic beaker, 250 μL of microbial inoculum was added with 2 mL deionized water to fully soak the litter sample.
The TOC measurements revealed that there was approximately 20 μg C in the inoculum for each plastic beaker, which represents less than 0.3% of total CO$_2$-C produced during the incubation.
The 50-mL beakers were then placed into 473 mL glass jars, sealed, and incubated at 20°C in the dark.
Microbial respiration was estimated by measuring CO$_2$ production during the incubation.
For each glass jar, a 1 mL headspace sample was obtained through a butyl stopper in the lid using a needle and syringe, and its CO$_2$ concentration was measured using an infrared gas analyzer (IRGA, LI-COR 820, LI-COR Corporation) every 1 or 2 days.
The IRGA was calibrated at each measurement time point using four CO$_2$ standards ranging from 500 to 25,000 ppm (Scott Specialty Gases, Plumsteadville, PA).
The CO$_2$ concentration was converted to grams CO$_2$-C using the ideal gas law.
All glass jars were vented when any single headspace CO$_2$ concentration exceeded 2%.
Average microbial respiration rate between two measurements was calculated as the increase of CO$_2$-C in each glass jar between the two time points per hour incubated per dry mass of litter.
Cumulative microbial respiration (CMR) for the 25-day incubation period was calculated as the sum of CO$_2$-C production in each glass jar per dry mass of litter and was used to represent litter biodegradability.

## Statistical analysis

Preliminary two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) found significant interaction effects between UV treatment and exposure period on most of the studied variables, suggesting that the effects of UV treatment should be examined for each exposure period separately.
Therefore, we conducted Student’s t-test to compare differences in litter carbon fractions, C and N concentrations, WEC, WEN, and CMR between the UV block and UV pass treatments for each period of UV treatment separately.
Before applying the t-test, samples were checked for equality of variances using Levene’s test.
If equal variances could not be assumed between two treatments, the degrees of freedom of the t-statistic were adjusted using the Welch-Satterthwaite method.
Pearson correlation was used to examine the relationship between litter chemical characteristics and CMR.
All statistical analyses were carried out in SPSS (Version 20, IBM Corporation).
