# **Materials and Methods**

## **Study Site and Plant Species**

Our study was conducted in the scrublands of Fray Jorge Forest National Park (30° S, 71° 40′ W), Chile.
The local climate is Mediterranean semiarid [@Lopez-Cortes2004], with extremely dry periods extending for 6–7 months (November–April) without rain, followed by humid winters (May–August) when >95% of the rain falls.
Average annual rainfall for the last 25 years in the study area is 151 ± 43 mm (mean ± 1 SE, CV = 74%, @GaxiolaUnpublished).
Higher annual rainfall is largely associated with extreme positive phases of ENSO.
For example, 1991–1992 and 1997 have been identified as El Niño years with annual rainfall between 240 and 300 mm.
In contrast, years 1988 and 1990 were extremely dry, with an annual rainfall of 11 and 33 mm respectively, and associated with the negative phase of ENSO, or La Niña years [@Gutierrez2010; @Jimenez2011].
Regarding the focal driver of our study, UV radiation can be extremely high in this area of northern Chile, particularly during the cloudless summer months.
According to the Direccion Meteorológica de Chile (DMC; http://www.meteochile.gob.cl/radiacion_uv.php) the UV index for our study site can be higher than 11 at midday during summer months.
Similarly, we measured UV radiation in our study site with broadband UV sensors calibrated for 280–320 nm (SU-100, Apogee Instruments Inc., Logan, UT, USA) and recorded unweighted UV mean values of 55 Wm$^{-2}$ during January with an absolute maximum of 62.4 Wm$^{-2}$ [@UnpublishedNA].

Predominant vegetation of the study area is a mixed scrubland characterized by the dominance of evergreen and summer-deciduous shrubs, 1–3 m in height, with a seasonal ground layer of annual species.
The thorny evergreen shrub *Porlieria chilensis* IM Johnst. (Zygophyllaceae) dominates the overstory layer with 25–35% cover, along with two deciduous species, *Proustia pungens* D. Don (Asteraceae; 10–20% cover), and *Adesmia bedwellii* Skottsb (Leguminosae; 3–6% cover), leaving ample open spaces between shrubs [@Gutierrez1993].
For the analysis of litter decomposition, we selected two of the dominant shrub species, with contrasting leaf habits: (1) the evergreen *Porlieria chilensis* and (2) the drought-deciduous *Proustia pungens* which are henceforth referred to by genus only.
These two shrub species differed in leaf mass per area (LMA), foliar nitrogen and carbon content (leaf-N and leaf-C, respectively), lignin content, and nutrient resorption proficiency (Table S1).
We compared litter degradation in these two species not only because these dominate the semiarid vegetation, but also because differences in green leaf traits can persist in senescent leaves and may in turn promote differences in litter quality and decay rates in the field [@Cornwell2008].
Leaf litter tends to accumulate under the crown foliage, which is absent during summer in the case of *Proustia*.
Hence leaves of *Proustia* are exposed to full sun for during the dry season.

## **Collection of Plant Material**

We collected green leaves and litter from 20 randomly selected adults of each shrub species within an area of about 3 hectares.
At least 10 g of green mature foliage and at least 20 g (dry weight) of recently fallen dead leaves were collected from under each individual.
Green leaves were collected by hand in mid September.
To facilitate collection of recently abscised leaves, we placed small litter collectors under each shrub, cleaned weekly to minimize sun exposure of fresh litter.
Litter collectors were placed in late spring (mid October) and removed before the onset of summer (early December).

At least 20 leaves per individual were scanned with a HP DeskScan II scanner (Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, CA, USA), and images saved at 1200 dpi.
Mean leaf area was estimated by counting black pixels on black and white scanned images using Adobe Photoshop 90 (Adobe Systems Incorporated, USA).
Leaves were weighed after drying at 65° C for 2 days (or until constant weight).
Data on leaf mass and area for each species were used to calculate LMA.
A total of 14 samples of dried green and dead leaves per species were ground to determine total C and N concentrations by flash combustion using a NA2500 Carlo Erba Element Analyzer.
Lignin content was determined following @VanSoest1963, using one gram of ground litter milled to 1-mm mesh size for acid detergent fiber (ADF).
Litter-N concentrations were interpreted as resorption proficiency (*sensu* @Killingbeck1996) after we corrected for changes in LMA, to control for senescence-related differences in leaf carbon.

## **Photodecomposition Field Experiment**

To assess the effects of natural UV exposure on litter biomass loss for the two shrub species, we established a photodecomposition experiment in the field.
The experiment lasted 5 months (December through April), including the entire rainless summer period in semiarid Chile.
During the 5 months, we were able to assess the direct effects of natural UV exposure on leaf litter dynamics in the complete absence of rainfall.
For this experiment, litter samples (about 5 g) were introduced in 15 × 30 cm litterbags built with a plastic sheet (UV filter or UV-transmitting film) on the upper side and a plastic fiberglass mesh (2 mm) in the back; mesh at the bottom provided ventilation and avoided overheating of the litterbag contents.
We manipulated UV exposure of the litterbags by using UV-blocking or UV-passing plastic sheets on the sun-exposed side.
Solar UV radiation was filtered out by using 125 μm UV-blocking film (Mylar-type Cadco clear polyester film, Cadillac Plastic and Chemical, Phoenix, AZ, USA; sharp transmission cutoff below 325 nm).
For the second group of litterbags, we used Plexiglas UV-transmitting film with a sharp transmission cutoff below 275, thus allowing for >95% transmission of the UV-waveband.
Litterbags with UV-passing plastic represented “control” conditions (UV+), and litterbags with Mylar plastic filter represented reduced UV radiation (UV-) treatment in the field.

We placed all 180 litterbags, constructed as indicated above (two UV-treatments, two species, 45 replicates), on randomly chosen areas located between shrubs (no shrub cover directly above), about 3–4 m away from shrubs from which leaf samples were originally collected.
Bags were placed in the field in December (onset of the dry period) and kept within the boundary of the 3-hectares study area.
We removed dead annual plant material that could cast shade on litterbags.
To avoid contact between litterbags and the soil directly underneath we lifted each litterbag with wires and anchored them at ∼20 cm above the soil level.
Photodecomposition thus reflects only the loss of mass due to solar radiation received by the bags.
All litterbags were retrieved in the midst of the austral autumn (late April), 5 months after the initiation of the experiment, and before the onset of the rains.
Eight damaged or broken litterbags were eliminated from the experiment.
Contents of each litterbag were placed inside sealed plastic bags to avoid dead matter loss and taken to the laboratory for dry mass estimates.
These contents were oven-dried at 60° C for 2 days and subsequently removed from the mesh and weighed.
We took subsamples from all litterbags for determination of total C and N.
Subsamples of material from 26 litterbags (per treatment and species) were used for lignin determinations.
Using these values we calculated litter-C, litter-N, litter C:N, and lignin:N ratios for UV+ and UV- treatments and for each of the two shrub species.
All chemical analyses were conducted in the laboratory of Agro-analyses from the Faculty of Agronomy and Forest Research, Catholic University of Chile.
Photodecomposition effect was estimated as the percentage of litter mass loss over the 5 months period of exposure to full sun.
Biomass loss % = ((initial weight – final weight) /initial weight)∗100.

Every month during the field experiment we monitored temperatures inside 10–15 litterbags per treatment, five times in 1 day, by sticking a mini *k*-thermocouple probe inside the bags.
The thermocouple was connected to a SM320 datalogger (Dickson Addison, USA).

## **Laboratory decomposition experiment**

To test the predictions about the combined effects of photodecomposition and soil moisture on litter decay, we conducted a follow-up decomposition experiment in the laboratory.
For this experiment we used litter subsamples taken from the UV- or UV+ litterbags from the photodecomposition experiment.
We weighted these subsamples in order to get at least 3 g of initial dry weight.
Each litter sample was placed over a 5 × 5 cm square of 2-mm green-fiberglass mesh on the surface of small plastic trays (15 × 15 cm and 5 cm-depth) containing 350 g of soil collected from the study site.
Each litterbag was slightly covered with a less than a teaspoon of soil, as soil particles may promote litter biomass loss [@Moorhead1991; @Barnes2012].
In August–September the total of 132 leaf litter mesh bags (2 species × 2 UV treatments × 3 simulated rainfall levels, 11 replicates) were randomly distributed over benches in a controlled temperature-room, where temperature was set at 23° C.
Litter samples were assigned one of the three water treatments that simulated actual ranges of annual rainfall recorded over the past 25 years in the study area: (1) low rainfall or “dry year” (water addition equivalent to 15 mm of rain), (2) average or “normal year” (equivalent to 140 mm), and (3) high rainfall or “wet year” (equivalent to c. 250 mm).
The latter amount resembles the rainfall of an El Niño event.
According to the 25-years instrumental rainfall records for the study site, in dry years an average rainfall event is about 0.2 ± 0.1 mm per day (or ∼0.02 ml cm$^{-2}$); for an average year, average daily pulses are 1.1 ± 0.3 mm (or ∼0.11 ml cm$^{-2}$), and can last 3–6 h; and finally, average pulses on wet years are 2.5 ± 0.4 mm (or ∼0.25 ml cm$^{-2}$) spread over 10–15 h [@GaxiolaUnpublished].
Based on this information we established the amount and frequency of water pulses for each water treatment.
Water treatments were provided in ml cm$^{-2}$, as 0.1 ml cm$^{-2}$ is equivalent to 1 mm of rainfall.
For the low rainfall treatment, and considering the size of the plastic trays (i.e., 15 × 15 cm) we added pulses of 0.02 ml cm$^{-2}$.
The equivalent of 15 mm of rain was added after 75 pulses over 2 months.
For this treatment we used a pipette.
For the treatment equivalent to an average year, pulses of water ranged from 0.5 to 1.1 ml cm$^{-2}$ until the equivalent of 140 mm of rainfall was accumulated (after 19 pulses of different magnitudes).
To simulate the condition of a wet El Niño year, we added pulses ranging from 0.8 to 2.5 ml cm$^{-2}$ until the equivalent of 250 mm was accumulated (i.e., 18 different pulses).
For the last two treatments we used trigger water sprayers of different sizes to control the water volume reaching the bags.
Water pulses were randomly distributed over the first 4 months of the experiment, with 80% of the pulses concentrated in the second and third months, as climatic measurements in our study site show that rains are greatest in June and July (80% of rainfall).

Every 20 days we shuffled litterbags to reduce effects of position along benches.
Six months later, litter samples were oven-dried at 60° C until constant mass.
Biomass loss was monitored over 6 months since the experiment was initiated in the laboratory.
Litter decomposition was estimated as the percentage of remaining biomass.
Remaining biomass % = (final weight/initial weight)∗100.

## **Data Analyses**

To assess inter-specific differences in foliar traits for green leaves and leaf litter before and after the photodecomposition experiment, we used pairwise comparisons based on Welch two sample *t*-tests.
Effects of differential exposure to natural UV radiation on litter biomass loss were tested using a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA; @Crawley2002), with species and UV-treatments as factors.

The laboratory experiment on litter decomposition under different levels of soil moisture was analyzed with a generalized linear model (*glm* routine in *R*) to test for the effects of the three irrigation treatments, the carry-over effects of previous photodecomposition in the field (UV treatments), species identity, and litter quality (i.e., litter C:N and lignin:N ratios).
We also tested for the interactions among these factors.
Decomposition, expressed as remaining litter biomass (%) was the response variable in the analysis.
A full model was fitted to the data and then reduced to a minimal adequate model by removing terms sequentially, starting from the highest-order interaction terms, and using *anova* command in R to test for statistical significance of each model term [@Crawley2002].
All data were checked for homogeneity of variances before analyses and appropriate transformations were used as needed.
Analyses were done with *R* [@RDevelopmentCoreTeam2011].
