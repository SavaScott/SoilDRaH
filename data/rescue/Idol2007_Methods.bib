Forward stepwise multiple linear regression was used to develop two predictive models. Effective soil depth, percentage stone, aspect, and slope position were predictor variables in model I. Soil profile available water capacity, slope position, and aspect were predictor variables in model II. Model I is the more practical and easily applied model in stands where soil depth can be rapidly determined; model II requires additional soil measurements but can be used to assess the more direct biological relationship between soil water and basal area. Models I and II accounted for 91 and 93\% of the variation in stand basal area, respectively, and were validated with data from seven additional mature stands. Subsequently the models were used to predict potential (maximum) basal area in eight stands where it had been reduced by disturbance; the models also were used to evaluate the effect of farming on the productivity of fields abandoned in the 1930s. Presettlement basal area was estimated to have been between 18 and 26 m

For comparison with a standard site evaluation technique, 27 undisturbed Quercus alba stands were used to develop another multiple linear regression model to predict site index from site factors. Soil profile available water holding capacity, slope position, and aspect were predictor variables in model III, which accounted for 73\% of the variation in site index, a substantial reduction in predictive value from model II, which predicts potential stand basal area using the same three variables. Simple regression indicated a strong positive linear relationship between stand basal area and site index (r = 0.85, P {\textless} .01). The strong relationship of stand basal area to soil and topographic factors and to standard site index measurements indicates that models to predict potential basal area may be used to evaluate site productivity in the Illinois Shawnee Hills.},

              Conventional chemical extraction methods to measure labile soil P are often inadequate for detecting fine temporal‐ and spatial‐scale soil P dynamics in situ. We refined and calibrated methodology for anion‐exchange resin‐impregnated membranes (AEM), related AEM‐P to soil solution P for a high‐P‐retaining soil, and evaluated the method's viability under humid tropical field conditions. We determined: (i) AEM recyclability, (ii) AEM P sorption kinetics, (iii) the correlation between soil solution P and AEM‐P for an Andic Humitropept, and (iv) potential interference from other anions (NO

              ‐S at 500 and 1000 mg/L reduced AEM P sorption by ≈98\%. The relationship between AEM‐P and soil solution P was curvilinear at both nonequilibrium and equilibrium soil solution P concentrations; it was essentially linear at soil solution concentrations ranging from 0 to 2 mg P/L. The AEM behaved as a dynamic exchanger rather than an infinite sink for P, particularly in the context of a low‐pH, high‐P‐retaining soil. The AEMs detected biologically relevant soil P pulses in the field decomposition study. The technique holds promise as an easy method for measuring soil P fluxes with minimal soil disturbance.},

	abstract = {To find a quick, relatively inexpensive measure for soil chemistry in the Mojave Desert (MD), we evaluated the use of the ion‐exchange resin membrane (IEM) plant root simulator (PRS) probe. Tests were conducted along a floodplain of the Virgin River in Nevada. Probes were buried at 15 and 40 cm. Probes were left in place for three time intervals (30, 60, and 90 d) in two seasonal periods (wetter [WP] and drier [DP], 2004), which were delineated according to the amount of precipitation and soil temperature and moisture. The sampling design was replicated in three pits during the WP and DP. Soil moisture and soil temperature were monitored at 25, 50, 75, and 100 cm. The probes were able to detect differences in ion sorption between the two burial depths, although differences were not always statistically significant. Ion sorption onto the probes generally increased from Month 1 to 3, but the result was not linear. The sorption of some ions fluctuated during the three‐month period, with ions desorbing and readsorbing or ion chemistry decreasing over the course of the study. Soil moisture and temperature did not appear to affect the probe's ability to detect differences across depths or season. Based on results from this experiment, we conclude that the burial time required for assessing relative differences in ion chemistries at our sites is one month or less and that the PRS probe may be useful for detecting relative differences in ion chemistries among other soils in the MD.},

	abstract = {The use of synthetic ion-exchange resins to examine ion bioavailability in soil and sediment systems has attracted much attention over the years. The first report in this regard was made 7-8 yr after resins were developed in the 1930s. So far, nearly 400 journal articles have been published related to use of resins in soil and environmental studies. The experience gained has led to more widespread applications in research as well as practical use in soil fertility assessment and fertilizer recommendations. Two commercial products developed in North America have directly resulted from years of research efforts. Recent developments in resin technology and availability warrant an updated review of the literature to aid in better understanding and utilizion of this technique.
            In this paper we provide an overview of historic and current developments in the use of ion exchange techniques in soil research. We also provide specific examples of successful use of batch and diffusion-sensitive ion exchange techniques in research and commercial use to assess ion availability. Finally, we address certain frequently asked questions about how the ion exchange resin technique is applied and how results are interpreted, including their advantages and limitations.

Incubation studies were used to study seasonal P transformations during simulated fallow with and without residue incorporation and P fertilization. Nine monthly additions of cellulose (765 µg C · g‑1 soil) with and without P (9 µg · g‑1 soil) significantly altered levels of total extractable organic P and inorganic P in incubated soils.
