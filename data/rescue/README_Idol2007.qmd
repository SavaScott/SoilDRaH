# Data Summary

This paper examines how precipitation and temperature affect forest productivity, soil nutrients, and leaf nutrients in Hawaiian Acacia koa forests. It explores the relationships between climate, nutrient availability, and forest structure across independent elevation and rainfall gradients.

## Fit for purpose: HiCSC

This data is identified as a data source for the Hawai'i Soil Organic Carbon Database https://osf.io/hmtv6/ as part of the HiCSC.

- Location: Keauhou Ranch (KR) 1600–1800 m elevation, Hawaii Volcanoes National Park (HAVO) 1200–2050 m elevation, and Honomalino (HONO) 1600 m elevation
- Soil carbon stock: Soil carbon stock is not explicitly provided, but total soil carbon content and SOM was determined from oven-dried samples in a Carlo Erba NA 2500 elemental analyser and the results are displayed in Table 2.
- Soil type: Andisols or as Histosols with andic properties
- Land use: Detailed land use in the Materials and Methods section.

# Tables and figures

- Table 1: Site characteristics for Acacia koa stands on the Island of Hawaii
- Table 2: Basal area and soil and leaf nutrients across a Mean Annual Precipitation (MAP) gradient for Acacia koa stands at 1600–1650 m elevation
- Table 3: Stand productivity and soil and leaf nutrients from 1200–2050 m asl at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park (HAVO)

- Figure 1: Location of Acacia koa study plots on the Island of Hawaii
- Figure 2: Influence of leaf mass per area and soil C on measurements of leaf and soil N
- Figure 3: Influence of soil P on stand basal area and soil organic matter

  
### Table 1

Table 1 was modified to include the footer in the header

```{r table1}

#| message: false

filename <- table1.file
read_csv(file = filename,
                   skip = 1,
                   col_types = cols(.default = col_character())) |>
  kable(caption = read_csv(file = filename, 
                                 n_max = 1, col_names = 'caption', 
                                 show_col_types = FALSE)$caption)
```
### Table 2

Table 2 was not modified during the transcription.

```{r table2}
#| code-fold: true
#| message: false

filename <- table2.file
read_csv(file = filename,
                   skip = 1,
                   col_types = cols(.default = col_character())) |>
  kable(caption = read_csv(file = filename, 
                                 n_max = 1, col_names = 'caption', 
                                 show_col_types = FALSE)$caption)
```

### Table 1

Table 3 was modified to include +- as ±. 

```{r table3}
#| code-fold: true
#| message: false

filename <- table3.file
read_csv(file = filename,
                   skip = 1,
                   col_types = cols(.default = col_character())) |>
  kable(caption = read_csv(file = filename, 
                                 n_max = 1, col_names = 'caption', 
                                 show_col_types = FALSE)$caption)
