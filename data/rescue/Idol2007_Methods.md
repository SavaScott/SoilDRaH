## Study site descriptions

This study was conducted on the Island of Hawaii, the largest and youngest in the Hawaiian archipelago (Figure 1).
The A. *koa* forests selected were all regenerated in abandoned pastures and degraded forest that had been used for livestock grazing since the mid-1800s.
Prior to that, they were most likely mixed A. *koa*–M. *polymorpha* forests, although few historical records exist of unaltered forest communities.
We chose stands that had regenerated into almost pure A. *koa* forests after livestock exclusion and ungulate removal.
Three sites were selected along the slopes of the Mauna Loa Volcano that varied in mean annual precipitation (MAP) from 1000–2000 mm.
The driest site (1000 mm MAP) was at Honomalino (HONO), part of the larger Kona Hema Preserve owned and managed by The Nature Conservancy.
Stands of A. *koa* were regenerated in 1978 after the cessation of grazing by deliberate scarification of the soil surface to stimulate seed regeneration.
The moderate precipitation site (1500 mm MAP) was in the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park (HAVO), owned and managed by the US National Park Service.
*Acacia koa* regenerated mainly from root sprouts after cessation of grazing and fencing and removal of all ungulates in the early 1970s.
The site with the greatest precipitation (2000 mm MAP) is part of Keauhou Ranch, owned and operated by Kamehameha Schools, a non-profit trust foundation.
Livestock were removed from a degraded mixed A. *koa*–M. *polymorpha* forest near the top of the ranch (1600–1800 m).
Beginning in 1977, separate 80-ha blocks were clearcut-harvested and scarified to remove all overstorey vegetation and to stimulate seed regeneration of A. *koa*.
We chose to study the stand regenerated in 1978.

At each site, stands were selected between 1600 and 1650m asl in order to control for variation in mean annual temperature (MAT).
At HAVO, we selected additional stands that ranged from 1200–2050 m elevation in order to establish an elevation/temperature gradient that was independent of the precipitation gradient.
The stands were classified mainly as subtropical lower-montane wet and moist forests [@Tosi2002], although stands at HONO, the driest site, were near the border of the dry forest transition.
Stand age varied from 25–30 y at the time of the study (2003–2004).
Stand density ranged from 1100–4250 trees ha$^{-1}$ (Table 1).
*Acacia koa* represented 100% of the basal area in each stand selected for the study.

All but one of the stands were situated on soils derived from surface lava flows and ash deposits that ranged in age from 1500 to 3000y [@Lockwood1988].
The stand at 1200 m at HAVO was on a 3000–5000-y-old mixture of ash and lava.
The soils were classified as either Andisols or as Histosols with andic properties reflective of the volcanic parent material: low bulk density, high organic matter content, and high water-holding capacity (Soil Survey Staff, http:/soils. usda.gov/technical/classification/osd/index.html).

Mean annual precipitation and temperature for each site were estimated from a combination of GIS data layers and empirical weather station data.
Data layers for the GIS map were obtained from the Hawaii Statewide GIS Program (http://www.hawaii.gov/dbedt/gis/index.html).
Mean annual precipitation for each site was estimated by overlaying rainfall isohyets [@Giambelluca1986] onto a map of site locations based on GPS coordinates.
Mean annual temperature was estimated for each site from MAT data collected from NOAA weather stations distributed across the Island of Hawaii from near sea level to ∼4000m.
Climate summaries were obtained from the Western Regional Climate Center website (http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/index.html).
Mean annual temperature at sea level and an empirical adiabatic lapse rate were estimated by plotting the 30-y (1971–2000) average MAT for each station against its published elevation and developing a linear regression equation.
Mean annual temperature at sea level was estimated as the y-intercept at 0m, 23.2 ◦C, and the empirical adiabatic lapse rate was estimated as the slope of the regression line, 5.0 ◦C per 1000m.

## Stand inventory and productivity

Three plots, 10 × 10 m each, were selected in each stand.
At the beginning of the study, tree stem diameter at breast height (dbh) was measured for all trees greater than 1cm dbh and 1m in height.
Tree ferns were excluded from these measurements.
Basal area was calculated as the sum of total tree cross-sectional area per unit ground area (m$^2$ha$^{−1}$).
One year later, the inventory was repeated to determine if there was a significant increase in stand basal area.
Basal area was selected as an indicator of site productivity, assuming these 25–30-y-old stands had achieved or were approaching their maximum basal area (Gmax).
Maximum basal area has been used for several decades to complement tree height at a standard base age, i.e. site index, as a predictor of stand volume and overall productivity [@Assmann1970].
Conceptually, Gmax is related to the crown growing space requirement for trees of a certain stem diameter at breast height (dbh).
As the individual tree crowns fill the available growing space, this sets the upper limit for the proportional stem basal area that the site can support.
Further stem dbh growth requires the death of competing trees to free up the necessary growing space for the expanding tree crowns.

More productive sites can support trees with proportionally smaller crowns, which results in a higher Gmax [@Baker2005].
Gmax is typically well-correlated with tree height at a standard base age (i.e. site index) as an indicator of site productivity [@Fralish1994].
The advantage of measuring basal area rather than height is that stands approach Gmax much earlier than maximum height [@Sterba1993].
The time to reach Gmax depends upon initial stem density and tree growth rates.
Therefore, in stands that are assumed or known to be approaching Gmax, basal area can serve as a rapid index for comparison of site productivity, even in stands with different stem density or somewhat different ages.
In our sites, there was no significant increase in stand basal area between the two inventory periods; thus, we concluded that they were approaching Gmax.
Basal area is reported as the average over the two successive inventories.

## Soil nutrient availability

We used ion-exchange resin membrane (IEM) probes to estimate soil nutrient availability in the field, known commercially as PRS-probes (Western Ag Innovations, Saskatoon, Canada).
The IEM probes consist of separate, semi-permeable cation and anion exchange resin membranes, each with a 17.5-cm$^2$ surface area encapsulated in a 3×15.5-cm plastic probe.
The IEM is meant to act as an infinite sink for labile soil nutrients.
In the field, however, IEM probes may act as dynamic exchangers instead [@Cooperband1994, @Drohan2005, @McGrath2000], meaning that they are in equilibrium with labile nutrients in the soil solution.
Additionally, adsorption of nutrients such as P may be curvilinear over a broad range of solution concentration [@Cooperband1994].
Despite these potential limitations, IEM probes have been used successfully in field and laboratory analyses.
Extraction of P in laboratory incubations using IEM correlated highly (R$^2$ = 0.99) with extraction using more traditional ion exchange resin beads [@Myers2005].
In a growth chamber study, N adsorption by IEM probes correlated significantly and positively with crop N uptake grown in a range of soil types [@Qian2005].
Adsorption on the IEM probes is sensitive to differences in nutrient availability associated with variability in soil water content [@Johnson2005], season of the year [@McGrath2000] soil depth [@Drohan2005], and litter decay rates [@Cooperband1994], with incubation times ranging from 14 to 90 d [@Drohan2005].
More importantly for this study, they have been used successfully in tropical Andisols to determine plant-available P [@Hernandez-Moreno1998].

For our study, IEM probes were inserted into the soil of each plot at a 45◦ angle to a depth of 5–10cm below the soil surface and replaced every 3 mo for 1 y.
Trials before the start of the study showed that the resin membrane surface was not saturated with the more available ions, e.g. Ca$^{2+}$ and NO$^-_3$, during this time interval, and results from probes used during the study confirmed this.
After removal from the field, probes were washed in deionized water and sent back to the manufacturer for analysis.
Nutrients are eluted from the resin surface in a solution of 0.5 M HCl and analysed for ammonium and nitrate on an autoanalyser.
Other nutrient cations and anions are analysed using an ICP-emission spectrometer.
Results are reported as micrograms of the cation or anion adsorbed per cm$^2$ of resin membrane surface.
Data are reported as the average over each 3-mo period.

After the end of the field study, soil samples were collected from each plot for standard laboratory extraction, incubation and analysis for available N and P.
Three samples from the 0–15-cm depth were collected in each plot and combined for analysis.
Samples were kept on ice during transport to the laboratory and then refrigerated at 4◦C.
Soil was sieved field-moist through a 2-mm sieve to remove coarse fragments, roots and particulate organic matter.

A sample of the sieved soil was oven-dried at 105 ◦C for at least 48 h to determine water content.
Then a 10-g oven-dry equivalent sample was extracted in 100ml of 2 M KCl by shaking on a shaker table for 1 h.
Extracts, including a blank KCl solution sample, were filtered through Whatman cellulose filter paper and frozen.
Samples were sent to the University of Hawaii-Manoa, Agricultural Diagnostic Service Center (ADSC) for analysis of ammonium (NH$^+_4$) and nitrate (NO$^−_3$) on an autoanalyser.

Additional samples were subjected to both aerobic and anaerobic incubations to measure N mineralization potential.
An aerobic N mineralization potential (N$_{aer}$) was chosen for comparison to previous studies in M. *polymorpha* [@Vitousek1988] and A. *koa* [@Pearson2001] forests.
Soils were wetted to field capacity and placed in flasks covered with parafilm to allow gas exchange but prevent water loss.
Soils were incubated in the dark at room temperature, ∼25 ◦C, for 28 d.
Field capacity was determined by saturating field-moist samples with distilled water on filter paper inside freely draining funnels.
The soils were allowed to drain overnight (∼16 h), and then they were weighed and oven-dried to determine water content.
This was used to determine the amount of water to add to field-moist samples to bring them to field capacity prior to incubation.

The anaerobic N mineralization potential (N$_{ana}$) was also determined to estimate the N contained in soil microbial biomass and overcome any potential N immobilization during aerobic incubation.
For the anaerobic incubation, soils were saturated with water and kept for 7d at 40 ◦C in sealed flasks.
After incubation, the samples were extracted and analysed for NH$^+_4$ and NO$^−_3$ as described above.
Mineralization potential for both aerobic and anaerobic incubations was estimated as the difference in available N before and after incubation.

Soil P fractions were analysed using the [@Hedley1982] sequential extraction method as modified by [@Tiessen1993].
This procedure extracts P from more to less available pools with sequentially stronger chemical extractants.
The anion exchange resin membrane probe was used to extract labile P (Resin-Pi).
Next, 0.1 M NaOH was added to extract non-occluded inorganic (NaOH-Pi) and organic (NaOH-Po) phosphorus, typically considered to be the exchangeable and mineralizable P pools, respectively.
Finally, 1 M HCl was added to dissolve primary mineral P (HCl-Pi).

The initial NaOH extraction was acidified to precipitate the soluble organic matter; however, this was not sufficient to remove all visible traces in solution.
We added acid-washed charcoal to the NaOH extracts and shook them gently for 10 min on a shaker table to adsorb all the remaining soluble organic matter [@Olsen1982].
After centrifugation, the supernatant was recovered for inorganic P analysis.
Tests showed no significant addition or removal of inorganic P due to the charcoal filtration procedure.

Total soil P in the NaOH fraction was determined by digesting the extract with ammonium persulphate [@Tiessen1993].
Extracts from all fractionation and digestion steps were analysed for inorganic P using the citric acid-molybdate colorimetric procedure on a UV-visible spectrophotometer [@Murphy1962].
Organic P in the NaOH fraction was calculated as the difference between total P and NaOH-Pi.

## Soil organic matter, C and N content

Soil organic matter content was determined via loss on ignition in a muffle furnace.
Oven-dried soil samples were weighed into acid-washed crucibles that had previously been heated to 500 ◦C to remove any surface organic contaminants.
The samples were then slowly brought up to 500 ◦C over a 4-h period in the muffle furnace and allowed to combust for an additional 4 h.
The samples were cooled to ∼200 ◦C, placed in a desiccator until they cooled to room temperature and then reweighed.
Organic matter content was calculated as the change in mass before and after combustion.
Total soil C and N content were determined from oven-dried samples in a Carlo Erba NA 2500 elemental analyser.

## Leaf mass per area and nutrient concentration

A pruning pole with extensions was used to clip terminal branches in the upper canopy that contained fully expanded A. *koa* phyllodes, the swollen rachis of the compound leaf that replaces true leaves on mature plants.
In each plot, five phyllodes were collected from each of three different trees and combined in a paper bag for a total of 15 leaves per plot and 45 leaves per site.
Leaf mass per area (LMA, g m$^{−2}$) was determined on fresh leaf samples using a flat-bed scanner.
Leaves for nutrient analysis were oven-dried at 70 ◦C and ground through a Wiley mill to pass a 1-mm mesh screen.
Leaves were sent to ADSC for analysis of N using an elemental analyser and for P via ICP-emission spectroscopy.
Leaf nutrient concentration is reported on a leaf-mass (mg g$^{−1}$) and leaf-area (g m$^{−2}$) basis.

## Data Analyses

Although replicate plots were randomly established within each stand, the stands themselves represented unique geographical locations.
Thus, the replicate plots were not randomly distributed in space.
This raises the problem of pseudoreplication [@Hurlbert1984], in which differences across the gradients may be due to uncontrolled sources of variation inherent to the particular geographic location of each stand rather than to differences in elevation or precipitation.
For our study, the most likely sources of uncontrolled variation included genetic differences among the populations of A. *koa* and the thinner ash deposition on the soil at the driest site, HONO.

Despite these limitations, we chose to compare stands along the precipitation gradient by one-way analysis of variance (Proc ANOVA), using SAS software, Version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC).
Where significant differences were indicated, we used Tukey’s means separation test to distinguish significant differences among the sites.
A significance level of 95% (P < 0.05) was used for the ANOVA and means separation tests.

We chose a regression approach to analyse differences along the elevation gradient at HAVO.
Basal area and plant and soil nutrients were regressed against elevation using a linear regression approach in SAS (Proc REG).
Again, significance was determined at the 95% level, and the strength of the correlation was reported as the R$^2$-value.
This avoids the problem of pseudoreplication but lacks the inferential power of an ANOVA.
We also regressed basal area and leaf and soil nutrient values against each other to explore their interrelationships.
